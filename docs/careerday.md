1. Quick Opening: Setting the Stage (2 minutes)
	•	Start with a Hook:
	•	“We’re living through a revolution right now, just like the Industrial Revolution and the Computer Revolution before it. But here’s the difference: this one is happening a lot faster.”
	•	Quick Historical Context:
	•	“In the Industrial Revolution, master weavers and blacksmiths lost their jobs to machines. In the Computer Revolution, typists and switchboard operators disappeared. Each time, people who adapted thrived, and those who didn’t were left behind.”

2. Show the Power of AI with a Live Demo (6 minutes)
	•	Setup: Build a Website Using Bolt.new
	•	Start the demo right away: “Let’s see AI in action. Imagine you’re a developer—this used to take hours or days, and now AI does it in seconds.”
	•	Narrate as the site builds:
	•	“Notice how AI handles the routine work instantly. What does this mean for jobs? Developers still matter, but they need new skills—like creativity, user focus, and problem-solving.”
	•	Interactive Question:
	•	Ask students: “If AI can build websites this quickly, what else could it automate?”

3. Rapid Progress of AI (3 minutes)
	•	AI Evolution Timeline:
	•	“In 2019, AI couldn’t write essays or create art. By 2023, tools like ChatGPT and DALL·E were mainstream. Now, AI can build websites, diagnose diseases, and even compose music. This isn’t decades—it’s happening in just a few years.”
	•	Challenge Their Thinking:
	•	“If AI is growing this fast, how will the world of work look when you graduate? What skills will matter?”

4. The Risk of Outsourcing Learning (3 minutes)
	•	Pose the Question:
	•	“If I can use AI to write essays or solve problems, why do I need to hire you?”
	•	Explain the Risk:
	•	“AI can do the work, but it can’t think critically, solve big problems, or make decisions. If you use AI to do your homework, you’re outsourcing your learning—and that makes you replaceable.”
	•	Encourage Action:
	•	“Use AI to learn faster, but don’t skip the hard work. The people who succeed will know how to work with AI, not just rely on it.”

5. Closing Inspiration (1 minute)
	•	Leave Them Wondering:
	•	“Think about how fast AI has grown. What will it look like when you graduate? What role will you play in shaping it?”
	•	Call to Action:
	•	“This revolution is happening, and you have the tools to be part of it. What will you create?”

Why It Works
	•	Focuses on Key Themes: Revolution, rapid progress, risks of relying on AI, and inspiration.
	•	Demo is the Star: Keeps their attention while making the implications real.
	•	Call to Action: Ends on a motivating and forward-thinking note.
