      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Preparing High School Students for an AI-Driven Future</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">As we approach 2025, the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on career paths is becoming increasingly profound and complex. High school students today need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving job market that will look very different by the time they enter the workforce. Here's a comprehensive analysis of what high school students should consider regarding AI's impact on their future careers.</p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Changing Landscape of Work</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">AI is reshaping the job market in unprecedented ways, particularly impacting white-collar professions. By 2030, an estimated 14% of the global workforce may need to change careers due to AI and automation. This shift is not just about job displacement; it's about the transformation of existing roles and the creation of entirely new ones.</p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Preparing for an AI-Driven Future</h2>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Develop AI Literacy</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Understanding AI fundamentals is becoming as crucial as basic digital skills. Students should learn to recognize AI in digital platforms, develop a basic knowledge of AI and its limitations, critically analyze different types of AI, and understand ethical issues surrounding AI use.</p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Focus on Uniquely Human Skills</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">AI excels at data processing and pattern recognition, but struggles with tasks requiring emotional intelligence, creativity, and complex problem-solving. Students should cultivate critical thinking, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, interpersonal skills, adaptability, resilience, ethical reasoning, and decision-making.</p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Embrace Interdisciplinary Learning</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">The future workforce will require individuals who can bridge the gap between technology and other fields. Students should combine STEM education with humanities and social sciences, develop a multidisciplinary skill set, and learn to apply AI tools across various domains.</p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Emerging Career Opportunities</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">While some jobs may be at risk, AI is also creating new career paths. Roles like AI specialists, data scientists, analysts, and AI-human collaboration experts are in high demand.</p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">The rise of AI presents both challenges and opportunities for high school students planning their future careers. The key to success in this AI-driven future lies in developing a combination of technical AI literacy, uniquely human skills, and the ability to adapt to rapid change.</p>
