      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">The AI Revolution and the Future of Work: Navigating the Changing Landscape</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance at an unprecedented pace, its impact on the workforce is becoming increasingly profound. This article explores the latest projections and insights on how AI is reshaping employment across various sectors, with a particular focus on white-collar job disruptions.</p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Current State of AI in the Workforce</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Recent studies indicate that AI's influence on the job market is accelerating. According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2025, technology, particularly AI, will be the most disruptive force shaping the labor market over the next five years. The report projects that advances in AI and information-processing technologies will create 19 million jobs while displacing 9 million.</p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">White-Collar Job Disruptions</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Contrary to previous technological revolutions that primarily affected blue-collar workers, AI is now posing a significant threat to white-collar professions. Knowledge workers, software and coding jobs, legal and accounting positions, and remote work are particularly vulnerable.</p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Projections for the Future</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Goldman Sachs predicts that AI could impact 300 million jobs globally due to automation. By 2030, 77% of employers plan to prioritize reskilling and upskilling their workforce to enhance collaboration with AI systems. Work tasks are expected to be nearly evenly divided between human, machine, and hybrid approaches.</p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Emerging Trends and Considerations</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">AI augmentation, skill shift, virtual agglomeration, sector resilience, and educational adaptation are key trends shaping the future of work.</p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Workforce transition, ethical considerations, regulatory frameworks, and AI literacy are critical challenges and opportunities in the AI-driven workplace.</p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">The AI revolution is reshaping the workforce in unprecedented ways, particularly impacting white-collar professions. While job displacement is a significant concern, the emergence of new roles and the potential for AI to augment human capabilities present opportunities for those who can adapt.</p>
